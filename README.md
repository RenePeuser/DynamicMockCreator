# DynamicMockCreator

This project was made to simplify unit test. The problem which we have in our daily work is, that you have to create big data structures to test some components. If you only interesting in, that this data container goes from component A to component B. Your are not interesting of the specific data of that container.

For this reason i create an "ObjectCreator" which can create data structures dynamically.
